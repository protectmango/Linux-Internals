18. **Write a C program to demonstrate:**  
    - Use of System V message queue for IPC between parent and child process.  
    - The parent sends three messages to the message queue.  
    - The child reads each message and prints it.  
    - After receiving all messages, the child sends a SIGTERM signal to itself to terminate.  
    - The parent waits for the child using wait().

19. **Write a C program to demonstrate:**  
    - Creation of a child process using fork().  
    - Communication between parent and child using a pipe.  
    - The parent sends a message through the pipe to the child.  
    - The child reads the message and sends a SIGUSR signal to the parent.  
    - The parent handles the signal using a signal handler function.  
    - Parent uses wait() to wait for the child to finish.
